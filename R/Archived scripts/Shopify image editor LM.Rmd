This file will read all images in a chosen directory and execute the below steps.

1. Read all images, flatten them, and re-write to original folder
2. Read file information such as size, type, height and width
3. Identify images where the megapixel dimensions are > 20 MP (the Shopify maximum)
4. Identify images that are not square (if you ask it to)
5. Work out what adjustment is needed to get the oversized images < 20 MP
6. Execute the change (preserving aspect ratio) and overwrite the file in the original directory with the updated version
7. Identify images that are greater than 20MB in size, and resize them to max 20 MB
8.
